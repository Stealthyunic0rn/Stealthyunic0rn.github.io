            <description>If you ask a bunch of college students what cybersecurity is or the industry&amp;rsquo;s opportunities, they will most likely say hackers. They probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know what pentesters are. At least, that&amp;rsquo;s what I thought when I was in college. Starting out in this field, I was open to many opportunities and learned about many new roles. My first internship was creating policies for the organization, and I quickly realized the &amp;ldquo;business&amp;rdquo; side wasn&amp;rsquo;t for me.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you ask a bunch of college students what cybersecurity is or the industry&rsquo;s opportunities, they will most likely say hackers. They probably wouldn&rsquo;t know what pentesters are. At least, that&rsquo;s what I thought when I was in college. Starting out in this field, I was open to many opportunities and learned about many new roles. My first internship was creating policies for the organization, and I quickly realized the &ldquo;business&rdquo; side wasn&rsquo;t for me.</p>
<p>I hate hearing new folks or students say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not technical enough&rdquo; or &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be a hacker,&rdquo; because I know there is more than that. If you want to be in the business, you will play a critical role in the organization, and a skilled individual will definitely be sought after. The same goes for the technical side. If you are like me and want to be a techy, then you will have vital roles; however, you will also have the fluidity of wearing and learning multiple skills that bleed into each other&hellip;in my opinion.
It is also very common for people to switch sides or do both sides of the house. Below is a small infographic of the different roles and sub-roles one can take.</p>
