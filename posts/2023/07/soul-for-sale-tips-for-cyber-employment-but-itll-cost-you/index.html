      <div class="post-content">
        <p>Here&rsquo;s another blog post on how to get a job in cyber. You have seen an abundance of different tips on Linkedin, professors and colleagues. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, they&rsquo;re good and even work. But in my opinion, most of those tips are copied and pasted from HR and then telephoned throughout the industry. Below is what works for me and what has worked for people I have passed on to. So, more ways to confuse yourself.</p>
<p>Getting A Job In Cyber:</p>
<p>Starting from students all the way to early professionals and career switches.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Internships as soon as possible (target for after sophomore year)
For the college students out there, please start applying for internships every year. Start in septemeber when the semester ends and you might get something in December or Summer of next year. Hands on experience is everything here. There is no alternative to real world exp.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apply early (Target for September of senior year)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As for when to be applying for jobs I say your Senior year September. I have talked to a lot of schools and presented to classes recently and the most common question I get is this. Some seniors wait till April or May to apply which is not ideal due the state of the industry, how long interview processes take and other factors. For anyone that has applied for jobs we all know it takes 3-8 months. For the folks that need sponsorship youu should be applying like crazy and super early. For internationals it&rsquo;s going to be difficult since a lot of orgs wont put in the funding for your visa or some may need security clearence. Dont set yourself up for failure and apply early.</p>
<ul>
<li>Networking<br>
Use your mom&rsquo;s coworkers, friends of a friend, that one professor that you dont really like but you know they have access to a tons of people. What alot of what me and friends did in college was search our Alum on linkeding and connect with them. Saying &ldquo;Hey I see you are an alumn of X I would love to connect with you. I was interested in opportunities at [where alumn works], and noticed you work here. I would like to learn about the work culture and what a typical day is like. &quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>-Personal Projects
If you are working in the tech industry its ideal that you have personal projects under your belt. Doesn&rsquo;t have to be building your own C2 Framework level but just something that shows the employer you want to be here. I reviewed a resume a while back and all they had was personal projects that acted like work experience. The resume overall needed work but to me as a techy I can tell that they are passionate about the work. Show your worth, a resume can only do so much. Its a new age of content, create youtube shorts, blogs or keep it simple and have a  github repo. Remember a business is putting resources and money into you. How can you help the company?</p>
<ul>
<li>Certifications
I am the wrong person to talk to about certs because as someone that hires, interviews and has been part of the student grind, I think certs are meh. Some people like being cert hunters with all the certs listed in their email, others just want to pass the test (but cant retain the knowledge), others do a mix of both (pass and learn).</li>
</ul>
<p>APPLY APPLY APPLY
Please dont let rejections affect you negatively
*show picture of my excel sheet
this is all the jobs i applied to I only got one offer out of college.</p>
<p>The reason the title says &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll cost you&rdquo; is due to the grind. You will first feel motivated, then after rejections, tired, then possibly anger. Then you might be on this really hot streak of applying every week then stopped. Its a rollercoaster, applying&hellip;.sorry looking for a job and the work that comes with it, is a job intself.</p>
<p>Have fun and if you have questions or want to chat reach out!</p>
