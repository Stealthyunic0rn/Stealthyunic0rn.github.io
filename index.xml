      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s another blog post on how to get a job in cyber. You have seen an abundance of different tips on Linkedin, professors and colleagues.

Below is what works for me and what has worked for people I have passed on to.</description>

My first internship was creating policies for the organization, and I quickly realized the &amp;ldquo;business&amp;rdquo; side wasn&amp;rsquo;t for me.</description>
